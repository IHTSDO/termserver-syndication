# Terminology Server Syndication Standard

As part of a strategy to move towards wider adoption of healthcare terminology servers which implement the HL7 FHIR Terminology Services x, a more effective way of distributing terminology would be from server to server through a syndication feed.

Based on existing work implemented by the [Australian Digital Health Agency](https://www.healthterminologies.gov.au/specs/v2/conformant-server-apps/syndication-api/syndication-feed/), this feed extends the [Atom Syndication Standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287).
