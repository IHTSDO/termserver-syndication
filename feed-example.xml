        Entry example for the SNOMED CT-International Edition - edition snapshot package.
        Features to note are
            * no sct:packageDependency element because it is an edition package which contains all its dependencies
            * this is a full package (as opposed to a snapshot package) and has the category SCT_RF2_FULL
            * the "alternate" link is the primary RF2 file for download in this version and there can be only one of these per feed entry
            * the "related" link is a secondary file, in this case the Release Notes PDF, and there can be many of these in each feed entry
            * the files in this entry use the MD5 hash function "sct:md5Hash" to check the validity of each file
